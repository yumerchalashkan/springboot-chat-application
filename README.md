# SPRING BOOT CHAT APPLICATION
## Summary
In this project, a real-time chat application was developed using the Spring Boot framework. Real-time communication is a crucial aspect of chat applications, and WebSockets provide a suitable solution for this. To handle WebSockets communication, the Spring framework provides support through its WebSocket support.

The first step in implementing WebSockets in a Spring Boot application is to set up the WebSocket configuration. In this project, a configuration class was created that implements the WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer interface. This interface provides methods to configure the WebSocket message broker. The registerStompEndpoints method was overridden to set up endpoints for STOMP messaging using SockJS. SockJS is used to provide fallback options for clients that don't support WebSockets. Three endpoints, ***"/message"***, ***"/disconnect"***, and ***"/connect"*** were created and set to allow connections from any origin. The configureMessageBroker method was overridden to enable a simple message broker and set up destination prefixes for message handling methods.

To handle the different events like sending a message, ***connecting***, and ***disconnecting***, a controller class was created. The controller class uses a service to keep track of connected users and broadcast the list of connected users to all connected clients. The service was implemented as an interface and its implementation was provided by a separate class. This allows for greater flexibility in case the implementation needs to be changed in the future.

A POJO class called MessageResponse was implemented to package message and sender information and send it between the client and server. This class has three properties: message, sender, and toString method. The message and sender properties are of type String and have corresponding getters and setters. The toString method returns a string representation of the class, which includes the values of the message and sender properties.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the use of Spring Boot to create a real-time chat application that is able to handle WebSockets communication and requesting from front-end and keep track of connected users. The use of the Spring framework and its support for WebSockets made it easy to set up and configure WebSockets communication. The implementation of a service to keep track of connected users and broadcast the list of connected users to all connected clients shows how the Spring framework can be used to create a more robust and flexible application. The POJO class implemented in this project shows how the Spring framework can be used to package and send message and sender information between the client and server.
